# game

This is a retro space-themed game created by Alec McGovern during the Web Development Immersive fall 2015 through General Assembly.  

Chrome strongly recommended.  Audio latency issues in Safari.  Firefox seems to work, although has not been thoroughly tested.  IE not tested.

Controls:  Arrow keys to move and Spacebar to fire --- Player 1
			"WASD" keys to move and Shift to fire --- Player 2

This game was created using only hmtl, css, javascript, and jquery.  One additional jquery library was used-- "Keydrown", for smoother arrow key movement.  Keydrown can be found at https://jeremyckahn.github.io/keydrown/ and downloaded for free.  

The font is "Sigmar One" and can be found at https://www.google.com/fonts.

All images, sound effects, and music were created by Alec McGovern.
